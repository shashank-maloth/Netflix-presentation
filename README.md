# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover insights into the types of content available on Netflix, trends over time, and key patterns using visualizations.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name**: `netflix_movies_detailed_up_to_2025.csv`
- **Source**: Netflix catalog (contains detailed information about shows and movies)
- **Features**:
  - Title, Type (Movie/TV Show), Director, Cast
  - Country, Date Added, Release Year
  - Rating, Duration, Genres, Description

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key steps in the analysis include:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Checking for null values and handling missing data
- Understanding data types and summary statistics
- Exploring categorical features such as **type**, **genre**, and **country**
- Time-based analysis (content added per year)

## 📈 Visualizations

Visualizations created with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` include:

- Distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Content addition trend over the years
- Top countries producing Netflix content
- Most frequent genres
- Duration analysis of movies

These plots help to visually interpret trends and uncover insights from the dataset.
